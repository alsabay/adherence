Cross-Sectional Analysis - Functional Health Literacy on Treatment Adherence among Type 2 Diabetic Clients This observational study is strictly cross-sectional in nature. As such, its main goal is to examine and analyze a cross-sectional snapshot of type 2 diabetic clients' functional health literacy and its relationship to adherence to medical treatment. Sample data is non-randomized and observational survey data therefore it is important to state that only summary statistics and correlational techniques are applied in order to understand the relationship if any of literacy to adherence. As such it does not reveal evidence of causation nor can it infer statistics to a general population of type 2 diabetic patients, but rather reveal the relative contribution (correlation) if any of the patient's functional literacy to adherence (see - https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d886/674ab022d6d34447320ed62b96ebab9ead60.pdf).
